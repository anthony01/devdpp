[1]: Data description
========================================================

- The data contains basic biometrical parameters (bust, waist, hips, height, weight)
of playboy models of the period 1953 - 2009.
- The original data is located at
[[Excel 120KB]](http://archive.wired.com/special_multimedia/2009/st_infoporn_1702)
- Prepared dataset can be found at [[csv 16 KB]](https://yadi.sk/d/FCGEKxaKeqDrS)
- Models are arranged by month of publication

[2]: Application functionality
========================================================
- Application provides simple data filtering by year range and tendency outlining
for the period chosen.
- Two datasets are used for visualization:
  + data for each model
  + averaged by year
- The data is presented in any of two systems of measuments:
  + Metric System (SI)
  + US Customary Units

[3]: Overall picture
========================================================
<small>
The overall tendencies for the long-term period can be considered expectable:
bust size goes down, waist size goes up, height goes up, BMI goes down.

[4]: Early period (1953-1963)
========================================================
<small>
At the early period we see quite opposite tendencies for all the parameters metioned
on the previous slide.

[5]: Late tendencies (1990-2009)
========================================================
<small>
The tendencies for heigh, weight and BMI of the late period might be considered somewhat
unexpected: both go down, especially the first one, while BMI continues recovering from 
dangerously low values.
